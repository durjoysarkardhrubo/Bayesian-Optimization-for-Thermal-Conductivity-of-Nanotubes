# Bayesian-Optimization-for-Thermal-Conductivity-of-Nanotubes
This repository implements Bayesian Optimization using Gaussian Process Regression to predict the inner diameter of nanotubes for maximum and minimum thermal conductivity based on experimental data. The dataset includes eight inner diameters (in nm) and their corresponding thermal conductivity (in W/mK)
